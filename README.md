# OOP-Project 1 
An OOP Employee Management System Project. 

The project's purpose is to develop an Employee payment management system. 
The Employee Class is an abstract class that forms the other classes: 
The SalariedEmployee class is the class that deals with the salaried employees in the company who have a fixed salary, bonus, and deductions. 
The HourlyEmployee: salary per hour.
The CommissionEmployee class: salary by commission.
The CommissionEmployee class is a superclass for the BasePlusCommissionEmployee class. 

Displayable is an interface that is implemented by the classes: SalariedEmployee, HourlyEmployee, and CommissionEmployee. 
It has two methods: displayAllDetails() to display the info of every employee. And displayEarning() to display the Earning separately.
